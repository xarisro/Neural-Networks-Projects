# Neural Networks Projects
This repository includes the code of two projects that we were assigned in a course of the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering in NTUA called *Neural Networks*.

+ The `A52-B10.ipynb` notebook includes a full machine-learning project over a large dataset of EEG signals. The dataset is firstly pre-processed and then several classifiers are used for the training process. The optimal classifier and hyper-parameters are found through cross-validation.
+ The `A52_Ex3.ipynb` notebook contains a project in finding the global minima of function with the use of genetic algorithms.
